# FEM2D-cracks

These are the source files for my PhD thesis.

***warning***
I took this snapshot around the time I was defending my thesis, so the sources might be quite messy (undocumented, unused files, unused functions, etc...).

You can find some instructions on how to use / compile the software in notes.pdf.

My thesis is in thesis.pdf.
