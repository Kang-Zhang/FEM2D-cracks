Relax() method will work in two stesp:
	- find a local solution for unknowns where the error is very large
	- find the global solution

Details:

	relax() is split into two parts:

		relax_local();
		relax_global();

	relax_local()

		// calculate error of the current solution:
		- KgC = Kg
		- insert global constraints into KgC
		- calculate error for each unknown
		- mark nodes corresponding to large errors
		- mark the nodes in their neighborhoods

		// calculate local solution
		- KgCL = Kg
		- insert local constraints into KgCL
		- solve for local unknowns

	relax_global()

		// reuse KgC from the relax_local()
		- calculate global solution
